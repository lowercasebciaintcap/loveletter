  <p><strong>Dear Hassan,</strong></p>

  <p>
    I’m so glad I met you and that you are a part of my life. I will forever be
    grateful because you are genuinely my favorite person ever, and I love you
    so much. It’s so crazy how close we became in such a short time.
  </p>

  <p>
    My day always starts and ends with talking to you. It feels so incomplete,
    and I feel restless when I don’t. What started off as something so silly
    turned into something so special.
  </p>

  <p>
    It feels crazy to say this, but I genuinely remember thinking, “Oh my God,
    I want to marry him,” just a few weeks after knowing you. I think it was the
    way we connected immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used to make so much dua for whoever I was going to end up with,to have
    certain attributes and for me to just immediately know. As silly as it
    sounds, you genuinely have all of those attributes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I always used to tell my sister and my friend, “Oh my God, I’m going to marry
    him.” I would talk about how much I liked you all the time. I always had
    this little feeling in the back of my mind and heart that you’re the one.
  </p>

  <p>
    You bring me so much joy, and you truly are my bestest friend ever. I could
    never imagine myself with anyone else, nor do I want to.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope we get to spend the rest of our lives together forever. I love you so
    much. 💗
  </p>
