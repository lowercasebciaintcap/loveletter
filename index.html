  <p><strong>Dear Hassan,</strong></p>

  <p>
    I’m so happy I met you and that you are a part of my life. I will forever be
    grateful because you are genuinely my favorite person ever, and I love you
    so much. It’s so crazy how close we became in such a short time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I always begin and end my day talking to you. And whenever I dont, it feels 
    so incomplete and I get annoyed. You remember little things I tell you and always 
    find a way to make me feel special. You always go out of way to make me happy. 
    I look forward to everyday knowing that I can talk to you. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I love how supportive you are of any and everything I do. You're so understanding 
    ,patient, and sweet with me. You make me laugh and always listen to my rants. 
    You make me less anxious and you even make me smile through a text.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used to make so much dua for whoever I was going to end up with, to have
    certain characteristics and for me to just immediately know. While it may be silly, 
    I feel like with you, I just immediatly knew. Ive never connected so well
    with anyone else. You just had all those traist: sweet, kind, caring, loving,
    humble, hansum, understanding, compassionate, soft spoken, patient, athletic, funny.
  </p>

  <p>
    I always used to tell my sister and my friend: omg, I’m going to marry
    him, hes so sweet. I would talk about how much I liked you all the time. 
    I always had this little feeling in the back of my mind and heart that 
    you’re the perfect person ever for me. I was like hes the one. I even wrote
    about you in my diary. 
  </p>

  <p>
    You bring me so much joy and so much happiness. You truly are my
    bestest friend ever. You really are irreplaceable. You are one of a kind
    and I couldnt have asked for a better baefy than you.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope we get to spend the rest of our lives together forever. I love you very
    much. 💗
  </p>
